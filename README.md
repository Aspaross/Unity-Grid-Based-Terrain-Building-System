# **Grid-Based Terrain Building System for Unity3D**

⚠️ **Work In Progress**

In this repository, you can find a prototype of a building system for simple `grid-based terrains` (built with unity tilemap grid system).

This system can be used as a foundation or starting point for games that require this building mechanic, such as city builders, RTS games, and tower defense games.
